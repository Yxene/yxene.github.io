# 🏴‍☠️  My CTF Challenges Archive

Welcome to my personal collection of CTF challenges!
This repository gathers all the challenges I designed for various competitions, organized by **competition** and **category**.

Each challenge includes:

- 📄 **Statement** – the original problem description.
- 📝 **Solution** – a detailed writeup explaining how to solve it.
- 📦 **Files** – downloadable resources (binaries, PCAPs, Docker images, etc.).

## 🔎 How to navigate

- Use the sidebar to browse challenges by **competition** and **category**.
- You can also search for keywords (e.g., "RSA", "XSS", "buffer overflow") using the search bar.

## 🚩 About this collection

These challenges were created for CTF events such as **UnitedCTF**, **PolyPwn**, and more.
They are now freely available for practice, learning, and fun.
