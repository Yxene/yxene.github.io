# 🏴‍☠️  My CTF Challenges Archive

Welcome to my personal collection of CTF challenges!
This repository gathers all the challenges I designed for various competitions, organized by **competition** and **category**.

Each challenge includes:

- 📄 **Statement** – the original problem description.
- 📝 **Solution** – a detailed writeup explaining how to solve it.
- 📦 **Files** – downloadable resources (binaries, PCAPs, Docker images, etc.).

## 🚩 About this collection

These challenges were created for CTF events such as **[UnitedCTF](https://unitedctf.ca/)**, **[PolyPwn](https://pwn.polycyber.io/)**, and more.
They are now freely available for practice, learning, and fun.

Feel free to fork the repo, host the challenges locally, or use them for your own CTF training.
If you spot any issues or have suggestions, open an issue or PR on GitHub.

✨ Happy hacking, and may the flags be ever in your favor!
